# Ethics & Responsible Use

URLShield is an educational tool for detecting suspicious URL patterns. Important rules:

- Only test using synthetic data or systems you own.
- Do NOT use this tool to attack third-party systems.
- The tool flags suspicious patterns â€” it is not an exploit framework.
- Keep logs and data private; remove any PII before sharing.
- Follow responsible disclosure practices if you find real vulnerabilities.
